#Optimizations on the Pre-Trained Models

#Precisions:
Precisions are related to floating point values - less precision means less memory used by the model, and less compute resources.
However, there are some trade-offs with accuracy when using lower precision.

#fusion:
fusion, where multiple layers can be fused into a single operation.
These are achieved through the Model Optimizer in OpenVINOâ„¢, although the Pre-Trained Models have already been run through that process
