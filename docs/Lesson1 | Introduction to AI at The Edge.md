Lesson1 | Introduction to AI at The Edge 

Q) what is Edge?
A) The edge means local (or near local) processing, as opposed to just anywhere in the cloud.This can be an actual local device like a smart refrigerator,
   or servers located as close as possible to the source (i.e. servers located in a nearby area instead of on the other side of the world).

Q)Uses of AI at Edge?
A) The edge can be used where low latency is necessary, or where the network itself may not always be available. 
  The use of it can come from a desire for real-time decision-making in certain applications.
  
 Q) Breif how whole functionality works in Edge applications?
 A) Many applications with the cloud get data locally, send the data to the cloud, process it, and send it back. The edge means there’s no need to send to the cloud; it can often be more secure (depending on edge device security) and have less impact on a network. 
    Edge AI algorithms can still be trained in the cloud, but get run at the edge.
