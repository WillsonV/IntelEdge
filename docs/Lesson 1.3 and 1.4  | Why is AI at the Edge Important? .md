## Why is AI at the Edge Important?
- Network impacts
- Latency Considerations
- Security concerns
-Optimizations for local inrefrence.


- Network communication can be expensive (bandwidth, power consumption, etc.) and sometimes impossible (think remote locations or during natural disasters)
- Real-time processing is necessary for applications, like self-driving cars, that can't handle latency in making important decisions
- Edge applications could be using personal data (like health data) that could be sensitive if sent to cloud
- Optimization software, especially made for specific hardware, can help achieve great efficiency with edge AI models

Lesson 1.4 | Application of Edge AI

There are nearly endless possibilities with the edge.
IoT devices are a big use of the edge.
Not every single app needs it - you can likely wait a second while your voice app goes to ask the server a question, or such as when NASA engineers are processing the latest black hole data.


- The apps which can't handle latency .These apps needs to process  real time data in approx no time.Edge Ai is needed in these type of applications.

Q) Which of these are reasons for development of the Edge?
A) Proliferation of devices  
   Need for low-latency compute  
   Need for disconnected devices
